##Welcome! 
###This is the awesome optimization project.

The **SRC** folder contains all the original files, without optimization. You can test using developer tools on a browser.
You will notive slow rendering speeds.

The **DIST** folder contains all the optimized files. Speedy and smooth. Notice that rendering times are several times faster
than the SRC files. 

Each folder has it's own README so you can see how each works. 

Cheers!
